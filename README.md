### [The Return of Disassembly Desynchronization](research/the_return_of_disassembly_desynchronization/the_return_of_disassembly_desynchronization.md)
> Although the recent version of IDA now has a fix for disassembly desynchronization, the fix inadvertently makes another anti-disassembly technique more stealthy and can also be used to hide instructions. Find out more in this post!

### [Hiding Call To Ptrace](research/hiding_call_to_ptrace/hiding_call_to_ptrace.md)
> The goal of this post is to make ptrace a practical solution for anti-debugging. The problem with ptrace as an anti-debugging measure is that it is too easy to __identify__ and __bypass__. Let's see if we can change that.</blockquote>
